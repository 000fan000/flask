Old Documentation
=================

This part of the documentation contains documents that are no longer
necessary in recent Flask versions because they document deprecated
functionality or changed behaviour.  We keep it around for a certain
period of time because it is still relevant if you relay on this
deprecated functionality.

You are however encouraged to upgrade your application to no longer
depend on this behaviour.
